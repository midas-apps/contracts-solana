# CAT-VII Duplication and Conflict Category

### 1. Duplicate Mutable Accounts

    Description: The same account is passed multiple times as a mutable parameter, breaking logical assumptions (e.g., the same account as both the source and destination of a transfer) and leading to unintended state manipulation.
    Remediation: Validate the uniqueness of mutable accounts (e.g., `account_a.key() != account_b.key()`).
