# CAT-VIII Error Handling and Stability Category

### 1. Error Not Handled / Unhandled Errors

    Description: The return value is not checked when calling functions that return a `Result`, and errors propagate silently leading to inconsistent state.
    Remediation: Use `?` or explicit error handling to catch all return values of the `Result` type.

### 2. Panic / Error Handling Issues

    Description: Operations that are prone to panics (e.g., `unwrap()`, division by zero) are used, causing unexpected program termination and transaction failure.
    Remediation: Use `Result`/`Option` to handle potential errors, and validate inputs before performing risky operations.

### 3. Unsafe Rust Usage

    Description: `unsafe` code blocks bypass memory safety guarantees, which may lead to memory corruption or undefined behavior.
    Remediation: Minimize `unsafe` code, and add strict validation and documentation when encapsulating it.
