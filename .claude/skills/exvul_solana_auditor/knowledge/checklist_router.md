# Checklist Router (Keyword to Rule Mapping)

Use this file in `S05_CHECKLIST_PLAN` to map natural-language checklist items to current rulepack IDs.
This router is for inference only; it does not modify checklist text.

## Mapping priority

1. Explicit `SOL-Rxxx` in checklist text
2. Router keyword mapping in this file
3. Fallback to `SOL-AI` when no rulepack-equivalent exists

## AI-only buckets (`SOL-AI`)

When checklist item falls outside current rulepack coverage, map to `SOL-AI`.
Examples:

- weak access control policy design
- authority transfer governance
- writable flag checks
- account type cosplay / relational data mismatch (general forms)
- arithmetic precision and casting risks (beyond multiplication-before-division)
- CPI reentrancy modeling
- PDA sharing/seed-collision/substitution variants not captured by `SOL-R005`
- panic/unsafe/error-handling quality
- randomness and oracle trust model
- DoS complexity and compute exhaustion (beyond lamport transfer pitfalls)
- testing/deployment process controls
- timely state reset / stale intermediate state
- cross-chain trusted chain/address validation
- inconsistent state update guards / no-op updates
- custom type trait derivation (Ord, PartialOrd) correctness
- orphan account lifecycle dependency management

## Expected evidence hints

Use these hints to fill `expected_evidence` in `checklist.plan.min.json`:

- signer/auth: `Signer<'info>`, `.is_signer`, `require!(...is_signer)`
- ownership: `account.owner`, `spl_token::ID`, `Program<'info, Token>`
- CPI: `invoke`, `invoke_signed`, program account constraints
- PDA: `find_program_address`, seeds/bump checks
- init/close: `init`, initialized flag, `close =`, zeroing/discriminator handling
- remaining accounts: `remaining_accounts` loop + owner/signer/executable validations
- lamport transfer: `**account.lamports.borrow_mut()`, `transfer`, `is_exempt`, `.executable`, reserved account checks
- CPI signer: `is_signer` on CPI account infos, balance pre/post checks, `.owner` post-CPI checks
- ownership reassignment: `system_instruction::assign`, post-CPI `account.owner == system_program::ID`
- Token-2022: `get_extension`, `PermanentDelegate`, `TransferHook`, `DefaultAccountState`, `MintCloseAuthority`, `getExtensionTypes`, `reallocate`, `CpiGuard`
- frontrunning: `expected_price`, `min_amount_out`, slippage bounds, upgrade authority init restriction
- data encoding: `data.len()`, `abi_decode`, `BorshDeserialize`, `try_from_slice`, `.get(..N)`, strict bool checks, full selector comparison
- event integrity: `emit_cpi!`, event fields sourced from `ctx.accounts.*` vs instruction params
